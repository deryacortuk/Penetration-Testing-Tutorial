## Aircrack-ng:

This tool is capable of cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK encryption keys. Moreover, it can capture and analyze network traffic to identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues.

## Wireshark:

Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that allows testers to capture and analyze network traffic. It provides detailed information on the transmitted and received packets, making it an effective tool in identifying security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Kismet:

 Kismet functions as a wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. It can detect hidden wireless networks, unauthorized access points, and other security threats within the wireless network. 

## NetStumbler:

 NetStumbler is a tool that can identify wireless networks and access points while also detecting security vulnerabilities in the wireless network. Reaver: Reaver is a tool that exploits a vulnerability in WPS-enabled wireless networks to recover the WPA/WPA2 passphrase. It is particularly useful in assessing the security of such networks.

 *There are several techniques for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks in wireless and Access Point (AP) environments, including ARP Spoofing, Rogue AP, Evil Twin Attack, Wi-Fi Pineapple, and DNS Spoofing. These techniques allow attackers to intercept and manipulate wireless communication traffic, providing a comprehensive MITM record for analysis.*


**Detecting a hidden SSID can be useful in various situations, such as when performing a security audit on a wireless network. The mdk3 tool can be used to detect hidden SSIDs.**
