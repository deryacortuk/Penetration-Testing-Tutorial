# Types of XSS Attacks:

# Stored XSS: 
Malicious scripts are stored on the server and executed whenever a user visits a page that displays the injected content. This can lead to attackers stealing sensitive information,
such as cookies or session tokens, from other users.

# Reflected XSS:
In this type of attack, the malicious script is embedded in a URL or input field. When the victim clicks on the link or submits the form, the script is executed in their browser.
Reflected XSS attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in input validation or filtering.

# DOM-based XSS: 
This type of attack involves manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page using client-side scripting. The malicious script alters the content of the
page, potentially leading to data theft or unauthorized actions.

# Impact of XSS Attacks:
Data Theft: Attackers can steal sensitive data, such as cookies, session tokens, or user credentials, which can then be used for unauthorized access.

Session Hijacking: Stolen session tokens allow attackers to impersonate users, gaining access to their accounts and performing actions on their behalf.

Defacement: Attackers may change the appearance or content of a website, damaging its reputation and user trust.

Phishing: Malicious scripts can create convincing phishing pages that trick users into entering their credentials or personal information.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Attackers can use XSS to force users' browsers to send requests to a target website, overwhelming its resources and causing a denial of service.

# Preventing XSS Attacks:
Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user inputs before rendering them in web pages. Use libraries and frameworks that provide built-in security mechanisms.

Output Encoding: Encode user inputs before displaying them on web pages to prevent scripts from being executed. 

Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded, minimizing the risk of unauthorized script execution.

Secure Coding Practices: Developers should follow secure coding practices and avoid concatenating user inputs with dynamic scripts.

Use of Libraries: Utilize security libraries and frameworks that automatically handle input validation and output encoding.

Regular Updates: Keep software and libraries up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
