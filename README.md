# DNS Resolution

● https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns

Note that to parse out the live domains we will need to parse the tools output. This can be done with a JSON parse, I will be using JQ for this. JQ is a 
command line JSON parser.

● https://github.com/stedolan/jq

Another thing to note is that you must also have a list of DNS resolvers for the tool to use. The most popular one is Google's “8.8.8.8”. If you have a large list 
you may want to add more.

./bin/massdns -r resolvers.txt -t A -o J subdomains.txt | jq 'select(.resp_type=="A") | .query_name' | sort -u

Resolvers.txt should hold your list of DNS resolvers and subdomains.txt holds the domains you want to check. This is then piped to JQ where we parse out all 
domains that resolve to an IP.
Screen shot : ● https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness
Once you download and install the tool you can run it with the following command: Python3 EyeWitness.py -f subdomains.txt --web

# Wayback machine crawl data :  ● https://web.archive.org/
Going to “https://web.archive.org/web/*/facebook.com/*” will pull down a list of paths that the Wayback Machine has crawled. We can then use the filter to 
search for specific files such as anything that ends in “.bak” as those might contain juicy backup information. Other interesting filters include:
● .zip
● .config
● /admin/
● /api/
Not only can you use this data to find interesting files but you can also find vulnerabilities by looking at the data. For instance, if you see the path 
“example.com/?redirect=something.com” you can test for open redirects and SSRF vulnerabilities. If you see the GET parameter “msg=” you can test for XSS. 
Wayback Machine: ● https://github.com/ghostlulzhacks/waybackMachine

# Common crawl data : ● http://commoncrawl.org/
The following script can be used to query the data provided by common crawl:
● https://github.com/ghostlulzhacks/commoncrawl
Run the following command to initiate the script:  python cc.py -d <Domain>

● https://github.com/OJ/gobuster

# Inspecting JavaScript Files
Link Finder :  ● https://github.com/GerbenJavado/LinkFinder
Linkfinder is one of the best tools for parsing endpoints from JavaScript files. The tool works by using jsbeautifier with a list of regexes to find URLs.
The following command can be used to parse links from a JavaScript file: python linkfinder.py -i <JavaScript File> -o cli

Jssearch:  ● https://github.com/incogbyte/jsearch
Jssearch is another JavaScript parser except this tool is primarily used to find sensitive or interesting strings. For instance, developers will sometimes hard 
code API keys, AWS credentials, and other sensitive information in JavaScript files.

# GitHub Dorks
filename:.bash_history DOMAIN-NAME
Usernames are often associated with passwords and api keys. If this was an engagement, I would use that key to log in to their application. A good list of these dorks can be found below:
● https://github.com/techgaun/github-dorks/blob/master/github-dorks.txt

# S3 Bucket Dorks
The following Google Dork can be used to find buckets belonging to a company: site:.s3.amazonaws.com "example"
There are way too many S3 bucket brute force tools a new one seems to come out every day. I typically use this one (its mine) but they all do the same thing in
the end:  ● https://github.com/ghostlulzhacks/s3brute
python amazon-s3-enum.py -w BucketNames.txt -d <Domain Here>

# Google Cloud Storage
Similar to by AWS tool it uses permutations to generate bucket names.
● https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCPBucketBrute
python3 gcpbucketbrute.py -k <Domain Here> -u

# Digital ocean Spaces 
site:digitaloceanspaces.com <Domain Here>
You can also try the brute force approach as well with this tool: ● https://github.com/appsecco/spaces-finder


 

# Shodan
This service scans the entire internet daily and provides this data to its users. If you have your target CIDR range you can use that to query Shodan. This will 
display all assets in that CIDR range that have an open port.
net:<”CIDR,CIDR,CIDR”>
You can also search via the organizations name. org:<”Organization Name”>
ssl:<”ORGANIZATION NAME”>

# Cencys : ● https://censys.io/ipv4

# Masscan
The tool Masscan was built to scan the entire internet in just a few hours so it should be able to scan a large organization with ease.
● https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
sudo masscan -p<Port Here> <CIDR Range Here> --exclude <Exclude IP> --banners -oX <Out File Name>
Make sure to enable banner grabbing as you can directly use that information to find potential vulnerabilities. To search through the results, you can use grep or 
you can use the web UI built by offensive security.
● https://github.com/offensive-security/masscan-web-ui

# Wappalyzer
Wappalyzer is by far the best tool for identifying web technologies. The tool analyzes an application's source code using a bunch of regexes to find out 
what technologies it's running.
You would have to manually visit each target application and write down their technologies. To get around this we need a tool. 
● https://github.com/vincd/wappylyzer
python3 main.py analyze -u <URL HERE>

# Firewall
Before you start throwing a bunch of XSS payloads at a target you should check to see if there is a WAF.
● https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f
Wafw00f <URL HERE>
The hacking community has been bypassing WAFs ever since the first WAF came out and much of it is documented.

# ICS
Industrial Control Systems or ICS have received a lot of attention lately. In the US the ICS-CERT was established and ENISA has a whole unit devoted to Industrial Control Systems/SCADA. But for most people working in IT it is still a relatively new playing field.

Because every area in technology has its own specific vocabulary I wrote a small intro to PLCs, ICS and SCADA of the different components that play in the ICS field.
What is PLC, ICS, SCADA?
What is an ICS?
What is an Industrial Control Systems or ICS? An ICS is divided into different parts.


Production network

Sensors, the input and output to the PLCs
RTU, the Remote Terminal Units (a PLC, to be used remotely)
Contains classical wireless networks
Supervision network
Sometimes called the SCADA network
Workstations with the supervision software installed
This is the place from where engineers manage the processes
Maintenance laptops
Servers specific to the process
Corporate network
Workstations
Connected with supervision network for gathering data for optimization
Import data to SAP (or any other ERP)
What we call ICS is basically production and supervision network. It is the network that has the connection with the physical world.

Vocabulary
A bit of vocabulary:

ICS : Industrial Control System

IACS : Industrial Automation and Control Systems

SCADA : Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition

DCS : Distributed Control System

Remember that SCADA is only one part of the ICS but sometimes people mix the terms. If someone refers to SCADA make sure that they don’t mean the entire ICS.

ICS Components
An ICS often consists of these components

Sensors and actuators : The connectors to the real physical world. Consider the sensor as some kind of switch and the actuator as the component that does the action.

Local HMI : Human Machine Interface, useful to interact with a subprocess

PLC : programmable logic control manages the sensors and actuators

Supervision screen : remote supervision of the industrial process

Data historian : records data and allows exporting to the corporate network

Stuxnet: game changer

The discovery of Stuxnet in 2010 / 2011 changed the view on ICS security. What is currently wrong with ICS security?

No awareness : they care about physical safety and not security, often remote access of the process is not always assessed properly;

Limited staff : only a few people involved with IT (and that most often does not mean ‘security’);

Lack of network segmentation : There are no real DMZ or firewalls. The access control is done via ACLs on routers. Sometimes it’s fairly easy to jump from the corporate network to the ICS network;

Vulnerability management : it is not easy to apply patches because you can not just shut down a plant. Often the Windows machines are not patched (sometimes because they are not connected to the Windows Update Systems). PLCs are sometimes updated with firmware updates but patching also requires a shutdown of the industrial process. Because of this, although the patches are published they are rarely applied;

Security protocols : there is no IT security included in the protocols (no authentication, clear text protocols, …);

Third party management : some environments need to allow remote support to their specific devices;

Security supervision : ICS is all about monitoring a process, not monitoring the security state of a process.

ICS is about monitoring an industrial system, not monitoring the security state of a system.


What is a PLC?

A PLC is a programmable logic control. It is some kind of real-time computer. It is designed to manage input and output of processes. It was invented to replace electric relays.

It consists of hardware, firmware/OS and applications. The last is one is the programmable logic that is run through the middleware. There are different ways to program a PLC. The “ladder logic” was the first programming language for PLC, as it mimics the real-life circuits. Afterwards there were 5 programming languages defined for PLCs.

Unity Pro is software that you have to use if you want to control most of the Schneider PLCs.

Where do you find systems on the Internet?

You can find a list of systems (not restricted to PLCs) connected to the Internet via Shodan. You can search for “interesting” strings. For example search for Schneider PLC: M340 or S7-1200.

# Modbus

Modbus Protocol

Modbus is a serial communication protocol. It is the most widespread used protocol within ICS.

I have a separate blog post with an introduction to Modbus TCP traffic.

Detecting PLCs

Next to using Shodan you can use a couple of scripts to detect PLCs on your network. A word of warning. The TCP/IP stack in some PLCs might not be fully mature. If you send uncommon traffic you might crash the PLC. Never do the scanning without permission.

You can use

nmap : network port scanner

PLCScan : PLC devices scanner (port 102 for Siemens, port 502 for Modbus)

Nmap has a script to query for example Modbus devices and Siemans S7 PLC devices.


sudo nmap -p 502 -sV --script modbus-discover 127.0.0.1

sudo nmap -p 102 -sV --script s7-info 127.0.0.1

Detect attacks on ICS devices

There are a number of techniques and tools that you can use to detect attacks on ICS devices. A large number of these attacks will contain a network component. This means that using basic network security monitoring and intrusion detection will already get you very far.

Honeypot

Conpot is a low interactive server side Industrial Control Systems honeypot designed to be easy to deploy, modify and extend.
