## Traceroute:

The traceroute command traces the route of an IP packet to an Internet host by sending UDP probe packets with a small maximum time-to-live, and listening for ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED responses from gateways along the way.

## Ping:

 A ping is a simple tool used in network administration to check if a specific IP address is reachable and can receive requests. It is also known as Packet Internet or Inter-Network Groper.

## Pathping:

 The PathPing command is a command-line tool available in Windows 2000 and later versions, which combines the features of both ping and tracert. It allows you to ping each node in a single command and also monitor the behavior of nodes over a longer period of time, compared to the standard four pings of ping or a single route of traceroute. 

## MTR:

 My Traceroute (MTR) is a powerful network diagnostic tool that combines the functionality of traceroute and ping to test connectivity and speed. It can be used to poll remote servers and measure latency changes over time, making it an invaluable tool for troubleshooting network issues.

## Additional resources for reconnaissance : Maltego, SPARTA

## Maltego

Maltego, crafted by Paterva in Pretoria, South Africa, is a potent tool for finding info and doing detective work. It is awesome at gathering data from open sources and showing it in a graph. With links to places like WHOIS, Shodan, The Wayback Machine, ATT&CK, Pipl, VirusTotal, and more, it opens up loads of data. It also has many special tools (transforms) to dig deeper.

## SPARTA

SPARTA is a powerful Python-based GUI tool designed for automated enumeration and vulnerability assessment, web crawling and brute force attacks. It streamlines the testing process by providing quick and integrated scanning capabilities, and presents the results in an easy-to-understand format, saving testers valuable time and effort.



## Legion


It is an open-source, semi-automated network vulnerability assessment and penetration testing framework. Its GUI-based interface offers extensive customization options and the ability to automatically detect Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPEs). Legion comprises hundreds of tools and scripts to automate scans, including Nmap, Hydra, WhatWeb, Nikto, SSLyzer, SMBenum, Dirbuster, Vulners, and Webslayer.

## MobSF

Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a comprehensive, automated security assessment framework for Android, iOS, and Windows mobile applications. MobSF can perform static and dynamic analysis to thoroughly evaluate the applicationâ€™s security. The MobSF framework possesses the ability to analyze Android applications during runtime dynamically. This framework, powered by CapFuzz, a security scanner specifically designed for web APIs, also has robust web API fuzzing capabilities. The analysis results are presented in an easily accessible manner on the MobSF dashboard and can also be downloaded as reports for further analysis and review.

## **Trivy**

Trivy is an open-source, multi-faceted container security assessment tool that can scan various sources, including container images, filesystems, Git repositories, virtual machine images, Kubernetes, and AWS. Trivy can identify multiple security risks, including Operating System Package Vulnerabilities (SBOM), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), Infrastructure as Code (IaC) issues and misconfigurations, sensitive information and secrets, and software licenses.
