# Manual Testing: 
Start with manual testing by exploring the application like a user. Interact with various features, input fields, and functionalities to identify potential vulnerabilities.

# Input Validation: 
Test input fields (forms, search boxes, etc.) for common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (SQLi), and Command Injection.

# Parameter Tampering:
Manipulate query parameters, cookies, and hidden form fields to check for security vulnerabilities related to privilege escalation or data exposure.

# Authentication and Authorization: 
Test for issues like Broken Authentication, Session Management, and Authorization Bypass to identify vulnerabilities that could lead to
unauthorized access.

# File Uploads: 
Check for insecure file uploads that might allow you to upload malicious files or bypass file type restrictions.

# Business Logic Flaws:
Analyze the application's logic to identify vulnerabilities that might allow you to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive data.

# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): 
Test for both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into input fields and user-generated content.

# SQL Injection (SQLi): 
Inject SQL code into input fields to identify vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized database access or data exposure.

# Remote Code Execution (RCE): 
Look for vulnerabilities that could allow you to execute arbitrary code on the server.

# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): 
Test for CSRF vulnerabilities by creating malicious requests that manipulate the victim's actions.

# XML External Entity (XXE) Injection: 
Test for XXE vulnerabilities by injecting malicious XML input to exploit parsing vulnerabilities.

# Open Redirects: 
Test for open redirect vulnerabilities that could trick users into visiting malicious websites.

# Security Misconfigurations:
Look for exposed sensitive files, directories, or configuration files due to misconfigurations.

# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):
Identify vulnerabilities that allow attackers to make requests from the server to internal resources.

# Information Disclosure: 
Test for unintended data exposure, such as sensitive information in error messages or hidden fields.

# Authentication Flaws:
Test for weak authentication mechanisms, such as weak passwords, password reset vulnerabilities, and insecure password policies.

# Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): 
Test for IDOR vulnerabilities that allow attackers to access unauthorized resources.

# API Testing: 
If applicable, test the application's APIs for vulnerabilities like authentication bypass, injection attacks, and data exposure.

# Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass: 
Test for ways to bypass CSP and execute unauthorized scripts.

# DOM-based Vulnerabilities: 
Explore the application's DOM (Document Object Model) for vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS.

# Brute Force Attacks:
If applicable, perform brute force attacks on authentication mechanisms or other areas where credentials are used.

# Session Management Flaws:
Test for vulnerabilities related to session fixation, session timeout, and session management.

# Client-Side Vulnerabilities: 
Test for client-side vulnerabilities like DOM manipulation, JavaScript injection, and insecure use of client-side libraries.

# Race Conditions:
Identify race condition vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access or data corruption.

# Authentication Bypass: 
Test for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
