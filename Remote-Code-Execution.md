# Common RCE Techniques:

Command Injection: Attackers inject malicious commands into input fields that are then executed by the underlying system, allowing them to run arbitrary commands.

Code Evaluation: If a web application allows user input to be interpreted as code, attackers can inject and execute their own scripts.

File Upload Vulnerabilities: Uploading malicious files with executable code can lead to RCE if the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize uploaded files.

Deserialization Attacks: Exploiting insecure deserialization can enable attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating serialized objects.

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Attackers abuse SSRF vulnerabilities to send crafted requests to internal services, leading to RCE if the internal service processes the request as code.

# Impact of RCE:
 
Data Theft: Attackers can access sensitive data, including passwords, user credentials, and confidential information.

Unauthorized Access: RCE can lead to unauthorized access to systems, applications, and databases. 

System Compromise: Complete compromise of the target system or application can result in data loss, disruption of services, and unauthorized control.

# Preventing RCE:

Input Validation and Sanitization: Properly validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code. 

Code Review: Regularly review application code to identify potential vulnerabilities, especially areas where user inputs are processed. 

File Upload Validation: Implement strict file upload validation to prevent users from uploading malicious files.

Security Headers: Utilize security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of arbitrary scripts. 

Least Privilege: Configure applications and services to run with the least privileges necessary, limiting the potential impact of an RCE.

Secure Configuration: Keep software and servers up-to-date and apply security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

# Exploiting RCE Vulnerabilities:

Ethical hackers should exercise caution when demonstrating RCE vulnerabilities during testing. Careful ethical considerations and responsible disclosure practices are essential to ensure that
discovered vulnerabilities are reported to the organization for remediation.
