# Types of Privilege Escalation and Authorization Flaws:

Vertical Privilege Escalation: Attackers elevate their privileges to access resources or perform actions beyond their authorized scope. For example, a regular user gaining administrative
privileges.

Horizontal Privilege Escalation: Attackers assume the identity of another user with the same level of privileges, allowing them to access data or perform actions they shouldn't have access to.

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): Attackers manipulate input parameters to access objects or resources they're not authorized to view, leading to data exposure or unauthorized
actions.

Broken Function Level Authorization: Inconsistent enforcement of authorization rules across different parts of the application can lead to unauthorized access.

# Impact of Privilege Escalation and Authorization Flaws:

Data Exposure: Attackers can access sensitive data, such as personal information, financial data, or intellectual property.

Unauthorized Actions: Flaws can allow attackers to perform actions that they shouldn't be able to, such as modifying records or deleting data.

Account Takeover: Privilege escalation can lead to account takeovers if attackers gain access to higher-level user accounts.

# Preventing Privilege Escalation and Authorization Flaws:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to ensure that users have access only to the resources and actions they're authorized for.

Least Privilege Principle: Assign users the least privileges necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the potential impact of a privilege escalation.

In-Depth Authorization Testing: Conduct thorough testing of authorization mechanisms across different user roles and functions.

IDOR Prevention: Implement indirect object references and validate user inputs to prevent IDOR attacks.

Access Tokens and JWT: Use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms like access tokens or JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
