# Injection Vulnerabilities:

SQL Injection (SQLi): Attackers manipulate input fields to execute unintended SQL queries,potentially gaining unauthorized access to databases.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by users,leading to the execution of these scripts in users' browsers.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Attackers trick users into unknowingly performing actions on a web application, often leading to unauthorized transactions or data manipulation.

# Broken Authentication and Session Management:
Brute Force Attacks: Attackers attempt to guess passwords or authentication tokens to gain unauthorized access.

Session Hijacking: Attackers steal session tokens to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access.

Weak Password Policies: Insufficient password complexity requirements allow for easy exploitation by attackers.

# Sensitive Data Exposure:

Insecure Data Storage: Sensitive data is stored without proper encryption, making it susceptible to unauthorized access.

Insecure Transmission: Data transferred between the client and server is not properly encrypted, making it vulnerable to interception.

# Security Misconfigurations:

Default Credentials: Using default usernames and passwords for applications and databases allows unauthorized access.

Improper Error Handling: Revealing too much information in error messages can provide attackers with insights into system vulnerabilities.

Exposed Sensitive Files: Inadequate access controls may allow attackers to access sensitive files, including configuration files and backups.

# Broken Access Control:

Inadequate Authorization: Poorly enforced authorization mechanisms may allow users to access resources they shouldn't have access to. 

Vertical and Horizontal Privilege Escalation: Attackers gain unauthorized access to other users' data or perform actions beyond their authorized scope.

# Security Vulnerabilities in Components:
 
Outdated Libraries: Using outdated third-party libraries and components may introduce known vulnerabilities. 

Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Incorporating components with known vulnerabilities exposes the application to exploitation.

# Security Headers and Configuration Issues:

Missing Security Headers: Not including security-related HTTP headers can expose the application to various attacks.

CORS Misconfigurations: Incorrect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings can lead to unauthorized data access.
