# Impact of SQL Injection:

Data Breach: Attackers can access sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information stored in the database.

Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify, delete, or insert data into the database, causing data integrity issues.

Account Takeover: By exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities, attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

Database Compromise: In severe cases, attackers can execute administrative SQL commands, gaining control over the entire database server.

# Preventing SQL Injection:

Parameterized Queries: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements that separate user inputs from SQL code, preventing direct injection of malicious code.

Input Validation: Implement strict input validation to ensure that only valid data is accepted by the application. 

Escaping Input: Escape user inputs to prevent SQL characters from being interpreted as code.

Stored Procedures: Utilize stored procedures to encapsulate SQL logic and reduce the risk of SQL Injection.

Least Privilege Principle: Configure database users with the least privileges necessary to perform their tasks, limiting the potential impact of an attack.

Security Auditing: Regularly audit and review application code for potential vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection.

Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Implement WAFs that can detect and block suspicious SQL Injection attempts.

# Database Vulnerabilities Beyond SQLi:

Insecure Configuration: Misconfigured databases with default credentials or weak passwords can be exploited by attackers.

Unpatched Software: Using outdated database software may expose vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

Inadequate Access Controls: Poorly managed access controls can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
